# README file detailing the use of FileObjectCreator

## Prerequisites
A DOMS updated to data model version 0.11.6.

## Acquiring needed files
The following data is needed to run the FileObjectCreator:
* a file containing a list of checksums, formatted as "<checksum> <filesize> <filename>", for files to create in the DOMS.
* a directory containing ffprobe-data generated by `ffprobe -print_format xml`, for each file:
** <filename>.stdout
** <filename>.stderr


## Updating config files
Example configuration-files can be found in the conf-directory.
* fileobjectcreator.properties must be updated with relavant values.
* logback.xml must be on the classpath, ie. in the conf-directory by default.


## Running the file object creator
./bin/fileobjectcreator.sh <fileobjectcreator.properties> <checksums>
or
cat <checksums> | ./bin/fileobjectcreator.sh <fileobjectcreator.properties>
