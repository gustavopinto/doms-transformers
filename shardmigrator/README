# README file detailing the use of ShardMigrator

## Prerequisites
A DOMS updated to data model version 0.11.6.1.


## Acquiring needed files
The following data is needed to run the ShardMigrator:
* a file containing a newline-separated list of program uuids to be migrated
  (can be generated with `bin/uuidExtractorForProgramObjects.sh <path-to-shardmigrator.properties>`
  or `bin/uuidExtractorForInactiveProgramObjects.sh <path-to-shardmigrator.properties>`)


## Updating config files
Example configuration-files can be found in the conf-directory.
* shardmigrator.properties must be updated with relavant values.
* logback.xml must be on the classpath, ie. in the conf-directory by default.


## Running the ShardMigrator
./bin/shardmigrator.sh <shardmigrator.properties> <uuids>
