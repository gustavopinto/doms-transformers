README file detailing the use of FileEnricher 

 ---- Acquiring needed files ----
 Prior to running the FileEnricher a data file needs to be obtained.
 The file ffprobe.result.tar.gz can be found on fedora@alhena:/home/fedora/transformers/fileenricher/ffprobe.result.tar.gz
 
 ---- Updating config files ----
 The configuration file fileenricher.properties should be updated to reflect the system being updated
 The properties for "successfile" and "failurefile" should contain the path and filename to files used to  
 write lists of UUID of succeeded and failed objects respectively. 
 The properties "domsurl", "domspass" and "domsuser" should be the location of the doms webservice, password and user respectively. 
 "ffprobe.files.location" points to the extracted content of the ffprobe.result.tar.gz file.
 
 ---- Running the file enricher ----
 Running the file enricher is a two step process. 
 First a list of files should be build, second the list of files should be processed by the file enricher. 
 
 ++++ Generating the list of files ++++
 To generate the list of UUID's run the 'uuidExtractor.sh' script. 
 ./bin/uuidExtractor.sh <uuidfile> 
 
 The parameter 'uuidfile' will be written to the distributions resource directory. The script assumes that the example
 configuration file is present in the distributions 'conf' directory under the name 'fileenricher.properties' and uses the 
 domshost, user and pass to connect to the webservice and obtain the list of uuid's. 
 
 ++++ Running the file enricher ++++
 The script 'fileenricher.sh' placed in the bin directory should be executed with two parameters. 
 ./bin/fileenricher.sh <uuidfile> <configfile>
 
 Both parameters are filenames and the files should be available on the classpath (the script sets its classpath
 to include the 'lib', 'conf' and 'resources' directories). 
 
 The 'uuidfile' is the file containing UUID's of the file object that are to be enriched (the file that was generated 
 in the previous step). 
 
 The 'configfile' is the configuration file for the file enricher. An example file is found in the 'conf' directory, 
 the example file also the one that should have been updated as described above.
