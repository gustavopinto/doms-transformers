# README file detailing the use of FileEnricher

## Prerequisites
A DOMS updated to data model version 0.11.6.

## Acquiring needed files
The following data is needed to run the FileEnricher:
* a file containing a newline-separated list of uuids to be enriched (can be generated with `bin/uuidExtractor.sh <path-to-fileenricher.properties>`)
* a file containing a list of checksums, formatted as "<checksum> <filesize> <filename>"
* a directory containing ffprobe-data generated by `ffprobe -print_format xml`, for each file:
** <filename>.stdout
** <filename>.stderr

 
## Updating config files
Example configuration-files can be found in the conf-directory.
* fileenricher.properties must be updated with relavant values.
* logback.xml must be on the classpath, ie. in the conf-directory by default.

./bin/fileenricher.sh <fileenricher.properties> <checksums> <uuids>
or
